# Transfer Learning


## About Project
In this project, we trained a deep learning model using transfer learning on the "Cats and Dogs" dataset. We were asked to separately implement data preprocessing steps and pre-trained model training. In the first part, we read the images and split them into Training, Validation, and Test Set. Afterward, we applied resizing and normalization to each set. In the second part, we chose the VGG16 model to be used. We fed the pre-trained model with our training set and controlled the training process with the validation set. Finally, we saved the best model which has the highest validation accuracy and test it with the test set and analyse the results.
