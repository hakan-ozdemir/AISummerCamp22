# Medical Cost Analysis and Insurance Forecast

## About Project
This project was done within the scope of Global AI Hub's AI Summer Camp'22. In this project, we used one of Kaggle's datasets, including personal medical costs based on age, sex,	bmi,	children,	smoker,	region,	and charges. First, we analyzed the dataset in both a written and visual manner. We also applied some preprocessing methods to our dataset. After that, we chose to test the following models as a regressor for our project;
- Linear Regression Model
- Ridge Regression Model
- Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression Tree
- Random Forest Regressor
- Bayesian Ridge Model
- AdaBoost Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor -RBF
- Support Vector Regressor -Linear

We must have chosen the best model based on the performance metrics and applied the hyperparameter optimization to that model. The highest accuracy belonged to the Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, so we optimized this model using GridSearchCV. Our ultimate goal was to use the best model with optimized hyperparameters to forecast insurance costs using the dataset mentioned above.


## About Dataset
- Name: Medical Cost Personal Datasets

- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- smoker: Smoking status (yes,no)
- region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
